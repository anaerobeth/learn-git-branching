Branch Spaghetti
WOAHHHhhh Nelly! We have quite the goal to reach in this level.
Here we have master that is a few commits ahead of branches one two and three. For whatever reason, we need to update these three other branches with modified versions of the last few commits on master.
Branch one needs a re-ordering and a deletion of C5. two needs pure reordering, andthree only needs one commit!
We will let you figure out how to solve this one -- make sure to check out our solution afterwards with show solution.

My solutions:
#First attempt - 10 steps
$ git checkout C1
$ git cherry-pick C5
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase -i one
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase -i C5'
$ git branch -f one C2'
$ git branch -f three C2
$ git branch -f two C2''
$ git branch -f master C5

#Second attempt - 10 steps
reset    
$ git rebase -i one    
$ git branch -f one master    
$ git checkout two    
$ git cherry-pick C5    
$ git checkout master    
$ git rebase -i two    
$ git branch -f three C2    
$ git checkout two    
$ git branch -f master C5    
$ git branch -f two C2''

#Optimal solution
$ git checkout one    
$ git cherry-pick C4 C3 C2    
$ git checkout two    
$ git cherry-pick C5 C4 C3 C2    
$ git branch -f three C2
