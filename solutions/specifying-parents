Specifying Parents

To complete this level, create a new branch at the specified destination.
Obviously it would be easy to specify the commit directly (with something like C6), but I challenge you to use the modifiers we talked about instead!

Use `git branch bugWork` with a target commit to create the missing reference.

My solutions:

#Three steps
git checkout HEAD~^2~
git branch bugWork
git checkout master

#Two steps
git checkout -b bugWork HEAD~^2~
git checkout master

#One step
git branch bugWork HEAD~^2~
